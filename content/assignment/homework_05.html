<h3>Homework Exercises:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Forecast</em>, Ch. 8, Ex. 1–2</p></li>
<li><p><em>Forecast</em>, Ch. 10, Ex.~1</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do the following exercise (call it 10.4):</strong>
Using the SLUGULATOR model at <a href="https://climatemodels.jgilligan.org/slugulator/" class="uri">https://climatemodels.jgilligan.org/slugulator/</a> or
<a href="http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/slugulator/" class="uri">http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/slugulator/</a>,
compare the impact of methane and CO<sub>2</sub> on timescales of 1, 10, 25, 50, 100,
500, and 1000 years.</p>
<p>The SLUGULATOR model simulates releasing a large amount of CO<sub>2</sub> and
methane and then calculates what happens over time. At time zero, the
concentration of each gas is the natural level from shortly before the
industrial revolution: 280 ppm of CO<sub>2</sub> and 1.6 ppm of methane. At one year,
a large amount of each gas is released instantly (after this, there are no
further emissions of either gas).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Run the model using the default model input parameters, setting the left
graph to “Concentrations” and the right graph to “Surface T Anomaly”.
Set the time scale on the bottom to show 10 years.</p>
<p>Move your mouse over the graphs to measure the exact values (a “tooltip” will
pop up next to the cursor telling the time in years and the value of the line
on the graph: concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> or methane, or the warming due to that
gas). Be aware that on the concentration graph, the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>
is plotted against the left axis while methane is plotted against the right
axis.</p>
<p>What happens to the concentrations of methane and carbon dioxide? Why does
the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> continue to rise after the first year, when
methane is falling?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the warming due to methane at 1 year and at 10 years? What is the
warming due to CO<sub>2</sub> at 1 and 10 years? (Use the mouse to examine the
time-dependent temperature plotted on the graphs, not the “Time-integrated
temperature” in the table at the top of the page). Calculate the ratio of
methane-warming to CO<sub>2</sub>-warming at each time.</p></li>
<li><p>Change the time scale to show 25, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 years. Make a table
showing the warming due to each gas and the ratio of methane-warming to
CO<sub>2</sub>-warming at 1, 10, 25, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 years.</p></li>
<li><p>Plot the ratio of methane-warming to CO<sub>2</sub>-warming over time.</p></li>
<li><p>Why does the ratio change with time?</p></li>
<li><p>Generating electricity by burning natural gas (methane) releases less than
half as much CO<sub>2</sub> than generating the same amount of electricity by
burning coal.</p>
<p>“Fracking” has dramatically lowered the cost of natural gas, and this has
made coal-fired electrical generation uneconomical, so about half of the
coal generation plants in the United States have shut down in the last 10
years.</p>
<p>Many people think replacing coal generation with natural gas generation will
reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions significantly,
but gas wells that use fracking also leak a lot of methane directly into the
atmosphere.</p>
<p>Comment on the significance of this homework exercise to the debate
over whether fracking is helping or hurting the problem of global warming.</p></li>

<h3>Notes on Homework:</h3>
<p>The GEOCARB model has two time periods: First, it runs for 5 million years
with the “Spinup” settings in order to bring the carbon cycle and climate into
a steady state. Then, at time zero, it abruptly changes the parameters to the
“Simulation” settings and also dumps a “spike” of CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere
and runs for another 2 million years with the new parameters to see how the
climate and carbon cycle adjust to the new parameters and the CO<sub>2</sub> spike.</p>
<p>Notice that some of the graphs show short-time behavior (the first 100,000 years
after the transition) and some show the long-time behavior (two million years
after the transition).</p>
<p>The quantities that are graphed include:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>pCO2</strong></dt>
<dd>
is the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere, in parts per million.
</dd>
<dt><strong>WeatC</strong></dt>
<dd>
is the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> weathered from carbonate rocks and moved to the
oceans.
</dd>
<dt><strong>BurC</strong></dt>
<dd>
is the amount of carbonate converted into limestone and buried on the ocean floor.
</dd>
<dt><strong>WeatS</strong></dt>
<dd>
is the amount of  weathered from silicate rocks and moved to the oceans.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Degas</strong></dt>
<dd>
is the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> released to the atmosphere by volcanic activity.
</dd>
<dt><strong>tco2</strong></dt>
<dd>
is the total CO<sub>2</sub> dissolved in the ocean, adding all its forms:
<span class="math display">\[\text{tco2} = \ce{[CO2] + [H2CO3] + [{HCO3}-] + [CO3^2-]}.\]</span>
</dd>
<dt><strong>alk</strong></dt>
<dd>
is the ocean alkalinity: the total amount of acid (H<sup>+</sup>) necessary to
neutralize the carbonate and bicarbonate in the ocean. The detailed
definition is complicated, but to a good approximation,
<span class="math display">\[\text{alk} = \ce{[HCO3^-] + 2 [CO3^2-]}.\]</span>
This is not crucial for this homework assignment.
</dd>
<dt><strong>CO3</strong></dt>
<dd>
is the concentration of dissolved carbonate ions (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>-2</sup>) in the ocean, in moles per cubic meter.
</dd>
<dt><strong>d13Cocn</strong></dt>
<dd>
is the change in the fraction of the carbon-13 (<sup>13</sup>C) isotope
relative to the more common carbon-12 (<sup>12</sup>C) isotope in the various
forms of carbon dissolved in the ocean water.
</dd>
<dt><strong>d13Catm</strong></dt>
<dd>
is the change in the fraction of <sup>13</sup>C relative to <sup>12</sup>C in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Tatm</strong></dt>
<dd>
is the average air temperature.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Tocn</strong></dt>
<dd>
is the average water temperature of the oceans.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In this homework, you mostly just look at pCO<sub>2</sub>, but in exercise 2 in
chapter 8, you also have to look at the weathering.</p>
</div>
<div id="details-about-the-assignment" class="section level3">
<h3>Details about the assignment:</h3>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Chapter 8, #1:</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Run the model with “Transition CO<sub>2</sub> spike” set to zero and change the
CO<sub>2</sub> degassing rate in the “Simulation” box. Examine how changing in the
degassing rate affects the atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>, the time
it takes to equilibrate (how can you tell when the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> has
reached equilibrium?), and how weathering changes to produce this new
equilibrium.</p>
<p>If you can’t see both the red line and the green line, that’s because the
two lines are identical and the red line is hidden behind the green line.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Chapter 8, #2:</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>I recommend approaching the exercise as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, run the simulation with the transition spike set to zero, the
degassing rate set to 7.5 in both the spin-up and the simulation and the<br />
“Geologic setting” set to 0 (meaning the present).</p></li>
<li><p>Then press “Save model run to background,” which lets you compare this
run to a different run.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, run the model with the geologic setting at 500 million years ago.
The sun was substantially dimmer then. How did this affect
the temperature and
pCO<sub>2</sub>?</p>
<p>The original run that you saved (present-day conditions) is labeled as
“Alt” in the graphs and the current model run is shown without the “Alt”
label.</p>
<p>The simulation is supposed to reflect a steady state, so if you see
pCO<sub>2</sub> changing, take a careful look at how much it changes during the
two million years the graphs cover (it should not change very much, if at
all).</p>
<p>How does the average value of pCO<sub>2</sub> compare to today? Why is there
such a difference?</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Chapter 10, #1:</strong></dt>
<dd>
Run the model with year = 0, degassing set to 7.5 for both the spin-up and
the simulation, and a spike of 1000. If you want, feel free to run it
several times with different values for the spike.
You’re looking for how long it takes pCO<sub>2</sub> to level out and how long it
takes pCO<sub>2</sub> to return to its original value (before time zero).
