## Catalog Description

**EES 2110 Introduction to Climate Change**
Science, policy, history, and causes of climate change on Earth in the last 
2 million years; evidence of human impacts on climate since 1850; future 
climate change and its economic, social, and ecological consequences; economic, 
technological, and public policy responses. 

## Narrative Description

This course will provide an introduction to the scientific principles of 
earth's climate, the causes of climate change, and scientific knowledge about 
the way climate has changed throughout our planet's history, with an emphasis
on the last two million years, and especially on recent history. We will study:

* Determinants of climate: What factors affect climate, how do we know this,
  and how certain are we?
* Scientific evidence about past climates: What do we know, how do we know it,
  and how certain are we?
* Natural climate change in earth's history.
* Effects of human activity on global climate in the last 200 years.
* What do we know about future climate change and how will it affect the
  quality of people's lives?
* What can we do to mitigate future global climate change or adapt to life in a
  different climate?
* What is happening politically, both in the U.S. and internationally, to
  respond to climate change?

The course will make extensive use of algebra, but does not expect calculus or 
advanced math.

## Goals for the Course

My goals for this course are that at the end of the semester:

* You will have a solid quantitative understanding of the basic physical and
  chemical principles that control the system and be able to apply that
  knowledge to reasoning about the climate system and its response to
  disturbances.
* You will have a solid scientific understanding of what scientists know, what
  they don't know, and how they know what they know about how climate works,
  how and why it has changed in the past, and how it may change in the future.
* You will be able to evaluate the evidence for and against the idea that human
  activity is warming the planet and assess for yourself whether the evidence
  is persuasive.
* You will have the tools and knowledge to make informed decisions about what
  climate policies you support or oppose.

When you leave this course, you will not be qualified to work as a climate
scientist, but you will be able to follow and critically evaluate news
reporting about climate change and climate policy, debate intelligently and
knowledgeably, and be an informed voter.

I do not care whether you agree with me politically. I respect people who think
for themselves.
**What counts is whether you can present your own position clearly and support
it with solid evidence and reasoned argument.**

# **Structure of the Course:**

I divide the semester into two parts:

1. **Scientific Principles of Climate:** For the first half of the semester, we
   will focus on the scientific principles of climate and natural climate
   change in earth's past. This will be very mathematical, using basic algebra.
   We do not use calculus or other advanced math in this class, but you should
   be comfortable with simple algebraic equations. We will then look at climate
   change in the last two centuries and what might happen over the next several
   centuries. We will emphasize examining the scientific evidence to understand
   what it can and cannot tell us.
2. **Human Dimensions of Climate Change** For the
   second half of the semester, we will focus on the ways that climate change
   is likely to affect people's lives over the rest of this century and what
   technological responses are being considered to reduce harmful impacts.

# Reading Material

There are three required textbooks.
I will also assign supplementary reading on the Internet or in handouts 
during the term and I will post these on Brightspace.

## Required Textbooks:

* {{< LONG_ARCHER >}}.
  Be sure you get the second edition because it is significantly different
  from the first.
* {{< LONG_NORDHAUS >}}.
* {{< LONG_PIELKE >}}.

There is a companion web site to {{< MEDIUM_ARCHER >}} at
[climatemodels.uchicago.edu](http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu),
which includes interactive online computer models that we will use for
homework exercises. 
You can also access that site at
[climatemodels.jgilligan.org](https://climatemodels.jgilligan.org).

## Overview of Reading Materials

{{< MEDIUM_ARCHER >}} is an excellent introduction to 
climte science, written by one of the leading climate scientists in the world
for students who are not science majors, but want to understand what science
knows about climate change.

Science aims to give correct answers to scientific questions, but there are
not right or wrong answers to questions of what is the best way to 
assess the economic costs of climate change or the best policy with which to
respond to climate change, so I have chosen books and other reading material
that present different points of view on the political and economic aspects.

## Class Web Site

In addition to the {{% BRIGHTSPACE %}} web site, I have set up a server at
{{% CLASS_WEB_SITE %}},
where I post detailed reading and homework assignments, 
slides from lectures, and other helpful material.

# **Assignments**

### Overview of reading assignments

I have posted detailed reading assignments on the course web site, which give 
specific pages to read for each class and notes on important things you should
understand.
**I expect you to complete the reading before you come to class on the day
for which the reading is assigned**,
so you can participate in discussions of the
assigned material and ask questions if there are things you don't understand.

### **Homework Assignments**

I have posted homework assignments on the course web site. Turn in homework
assignments on Brightspace. Homework assignments are due at the time specified
in the Brightspace assignment, which is usually at the start of class on the
day they are due. 

Late homework will be penalized 5% for each day, or part of a day, it is late
until I post the solutions (usually a week after it is due, but sooner if a
test is coming up).
After I have posted the solutions, late homework will receive up to 50% credit,
if it is turned in by April 21, so no matter how late it is, it will still
be worth finishing.


### **Tests**

There will be three tests during the semester and a take-home final exam.
The in-class tests will test you on the material we have studied. The first
two will cover the science and the third will cover responses to climate change.

I will provide you with a list of relevant physical constants and important 
equations. For the most part, I do not expect you to memorize equations and 
numbers, but there are a few numbers, such as the equilibrium climate
sensitivity and the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that
I do expect you to know by heart. Reading assignments will clearly state what
numbers I expect you to memorize.

The final exam will be an open-book, open-notes take-home exam.
It will be cumulative over all the material covered during the term.
It will not ask you to solve scientific problems, but will
ask open-ended questions about the big ideas we have covered during the semester.

The in-class tests will take place on {{< TEST_1_DATE >}}, {{< TEST_2_DATE >}},
and {{< TEST_3_DATE >}} and the take-home final exam will be due on
{{< FINAL_EXAM_DATE_TIME >}}

## **Basis for Grading**

|                       |       |      |
|:---------------------:|------:|-----:|
| Class participation   |  5%   |      |
| Homework              | 30%   |      |
| In-Class Tests        | 45%   |      |
| Final Exam            | 20%   |      |

# Honor Code:

This course, like all courses at Vanderbilt, is conducted under the Honor Code.

* **Studying:** As you study for this class, I encourage you to to seek help 
  from me{{< IF_TA >}}, from {{% TA_FORMAL_NAME %}}, {{< /IF_TA >}} or from 
  other classmates or friends.

* **Homework Assignments:** I encourage working together on homework with other 
  classmates, and you are free to ask friends and acquaintances outside of
  class. You may discuss assignments, compare notes on how you are working a
  problem, and you may look at your classmates' work on homework assignments.
  But you must work through the problems yourself in the work you turn in:
  **Even if you have discussed the solution with others you must
  work through the steps yourself and express the answers in your own words.
  You may not simply copy someone else's answer.**

* **Tests and Exams:** Tests are different from homework and labs:
  **all work on tests and exams must be entirely your own**.
  **You may not work together with anyone or receive any help from anyone
  but me{{< IF_TA >}} or from {{% TA_FORMAL_NAME %}}{{< /IF_TA >}}
  on exams and tests (this includes the take-home final exam)**.

If you ever have questions about how the Honor Code applies to your work
in this course, please ask me{{< IF_TA >}} or {{% TA_FORMAL_NAME %}}{{< /IF_TA >}}.
**Uncertainty about the Honor Code does not excuse a violation.**

# **Final Note:**

I have made every effort to plan a busy, exciting, and instructive semester.
I may find during the term that I need to revise the syllabus to give more time
to some subjects or to pass more quickly over others rather than covering them
in depth.
Thus, while I will attempt to follow this syllabus as closely as I can,
you should realize that it is subject to change during the semester.
