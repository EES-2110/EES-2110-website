<h3>Reading Notes:</h3>
<p>Study the one-layer model. We will work through it in detail during class.</p>
<p>Something many people misunderstand is the interaction of longwave
(infrared) light with the atmosphere. When the layer model shows
longwave heat going up from the ground to the atmosphere and also
going down from the atmosphere to the ground, it’s easy to think this
means the longwave light is reflected from the atmosphere back down
to the ground. This is wrong.</p>
<p>The light from the ground is completely absorbed by the atmosphere and
stops existing as radiation.</p>
<p>Completely independently of the absorption, the atmosphere has a
temperature and emits longwave radiation both upward and
downward based on its temperature and emissivity. Thus, the
brightness (intensity) of the longwave light going up and down
from the atmosphere depends only on the temperature of the
atmospheric layer.</p>
<p>Make sure you understand that the light going up and down from the
atmosphere is neither <em>reflected</em> by nor <em>transmitted</em> through the
atmosphere. It is <em>emitted</em> by the atmosphere as blackbody
radiation, and its intensity and wavelength depend only on the
temperature and emissivity of the atmosphere (for the layer model,
we assume that the atmosphere’s emissivity is exactly 1, meaning it
absorbs all longwave light that hits it).</p>
