<div id="water-vapor-and-latent-heat" class="section level3">
<h3>Water Vapor and Latent Heat</h3>
<p>Some key concepts from this section are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>sensible heat</strong> and <strong>latent heat</strong>. You should be sure to understand the
difference.</li>
<li><strong>equilibrium vapor pressure</strong>, <strong>relative humidity</strong>, and <strong>saturation</strong> of
water vapor.
<ul>
<li>When will a droplet of water in the atmosphere evaporate and dissapear?
When will it grow, or new droplets form?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="convection" class="section level3">
<h3>Convection</h3>
<ul>
<li>If a parcel of air is warmer than its surroundings, it will rise, and if it
is cooler, it will sink. This is the basis of <strong>convection</strong>.</li>
<li>If a warm parcel of air begins to rise, what happens to its temperature?
(Look back to the section on “Expansion, Compression, and Heat” and look at
the definition of <strong>dry adiabat</strong>.)</li>
<li>What determines whether a warm parcel of air continues to rise for a long
distance, or if it stops close to where it started?
<ul>
<li>This difference is the basis of the distinction between
<strong>statically stable</strong> (or <strong>convectively stable</strong>) and
<strong>convectively unstable</strong> conditions in the atmosphere.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What does it mean to be <strong>stratified</strong>? Can you see a connection between
<strong>stratified</strong> and the name of the <strong>stratosphere</strong> (look at Fig. 5-2).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="moist-convection" class="section level3">
<h3>Moist Convection</h3>
<ul>
<li>What makes <strong>moist convection</strong> different from <strong>dry convection</strong>?
For the same atmospheric temperature profile, will the atmosphere be
more stable for <strong>dry</strong> or <strong>moist convection</strong>?</li>
<li>Can you think of a way you could look at the atmosphere with your eyes and
tell whether convection around you would be dry or moist?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="radiative-convective-equilibrium" class="section level3">
<h3>Radiative-Convective Equilibrium</h3>
<p>Figure 5-1 shows the role of convection in moving heat around the atmosphere.
A layer model or purely radiative calculateion like we did with the
MODTRAN model will create a <strong>convectively unstable</strong> temperature profile
in the troposphere (the rate of temperature change as you go up in altitude
would be greater than the dry adiabat).
This is why the layer model’s prediction of the surface temperature is a good
deal higher than the actual surface temperature.
Convection moves heat from the surface to higher altitudes, which reduces
the surface temperature and also brings the atmosphere into a condition of
<strong>static stability</strong>.</p>
<p>To accurately predict the surface temperature, we need to account for
convection, so scientists make <strong>radiative-convective</strong> computer models, which
predict temperatures much better than purely radiative models like
MODTRAN.</p>
<p>The author of the book provides a web-interface to a sophisticated
radiative-convective model at <a href="https://climatemodels.jgilligan.org/rrtm/" class="uri">https://climatemodels.jgilligan.org/rrtm/</a> or <a href="http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/rrtm/" class="uri">http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/rrtm/</a>, which
you will use for homework for this chapter.</p>
