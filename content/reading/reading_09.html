<p>As you prepare for class, bring questions about things you didn’t understand
from previous chapters. Also, think about these review questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the laws of blackbody radiation?</li>
<li>How do you use a layer model?</li>
<li>What makes some greenhouse gases more powerful than others?</li>
<li>What are the important differences between the <strong>layer-model</strong> approach to
calculating temperature and the <strong>skin-model</strong> on pp. 45–46?</li>
<li>How does band saturation work? How can you recognize saturation in
MODTRAN?</li>
<li>How do you use MODTRAN to calculate the effect of doubling CO<sub>2</sub>?</li>
<li>How do you use the full-spectrum RRTM model to calculate the effect of
doubling CO<sub>2</sub>?</li>
</ul>
