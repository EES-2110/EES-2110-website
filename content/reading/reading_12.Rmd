## Reading:

### Required Reading (everyone):

* Understanding the Forecast, 7, 81--84.

### Reading Notes:

* Why are cloud feedbacks more complicated and uncertain than other feedbacks?
* What is El Ni&ntilde;o and how do feedbacks in the ocean-atmosphere system 
  create the El Ni&ntilde;o/La Ni&ntilde;a cycle? How does this cycle affect 
  the global climate?
* How do feedbacks between climate and the biosphere work?
