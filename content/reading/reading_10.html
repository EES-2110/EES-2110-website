<h3>Chaos</h3>
<p>The layer model calculates the average surface temperature for the whole
planet, but the MODTRAN radiative model and the RRTM full-spectrum
radiative-convective model calculate the temperature only at a single
location. Climate models do a much better job at calculating the average
climate for the whole planet, but people live in different places, and their
lives are affected by the details of how climate and weather change where they
live.</p>
<p>We’ve also looked at the question of why scientists are confident that they
can predict the climate 100 years in the future, even though weather forecasters
can’t predict what the weather will be a month from now with any confidence.</p>
<p>Both of these issues (predicting global averages versus local climate and
predicting climate versus weather) have to do with the <strong>chaotic</strong> nature of the
atmosphere.</p>
<p>Systems that obey <strong>linear equations</strong>, where the outcome is always proportional
to the inputs, are easy to predict, but <strong>nonlinear equations</strong> can become
difficult to predict and even <strong>chaotic</strong> (the behavior of chaotic systems
cannot be predicted with any reasonable precision more than a short time into
the future).</p>

<h2>Temporal Patterns of Weather and Climate</h2>
<p>Some things that contribute to the behavior of the weather have to do with the
way that sunlight changes both during the day, and from season to season during
the year. MODTRAN and RRTM models assume an average value of sunlight,
but if the sunlight is changing during the day or from season to season, the
temperature will also change.</p>

<h3>Spatial Patterns of Weather and Climate</h3>
<p>In Chapter 5, we looked at convection, which moves heat vertically, but
winds and ocean currents that move heat horizontally are also important.
Meteorologists use the term <strong>convection</strong> to refer to vertical transport of
air and heat, and <strong>advection</strong> to refer to horizontal transport.</p>
<p>A very important aspect of winds and ocean currents is the <strong>Coriolis effect</strong>,
which causes winds and currents to bend and follow somewhat circular paths
instead of straight lines. The <strong>Coriolis effect</strong> is caused by the rotation of
the Earth, and it’s responsible for storm systems called <strong>cyclones</strong> that
develop circular shapes.</p>
</div>
<div id="viscosity" class="section level3">
<h3>Viscosity</h3>
<p>If there were no friction in the air, winds would always follow perfectly
circular paths, but friction (also called <strong>viscosity</strong>) interferes with the
Coriolis effect and cause winds (and ocean current) to deviate from circular
paths.</p>
</div>
<div id="big-picture" class="section level3">
<h3>Big picture</h3>
<p>The big picture of this chapter is to show us patterns in space and time of the
way heat flows in the Earth system, and to introduce the idea of <strong>chaos</strong> to
explain the difficulty of accurately predicting weather and the fine points of
climate.</p>
<p>Climate models use the basic equations of physics (Newton’s equations of motion
and the thermodynamic equations of heat flow) to predict how the air and heat
will move around the Earth system.</p>
<p>To make accurate predictions, we can’t just average over the Earth
because the equations are nonlinear. This means that to make accurate
predictions, we have to calculate the equations at billions, even trillions
of points all around the world. The more points we include in our models, the
better their predictions, but the more computer power they need.</p>
<p>Right now, the most powerful supercomputers in the world are used to make
weather and climate predictions, but even they are not powerful enough to answer
a lot of questions scientists want to ask.</p>
