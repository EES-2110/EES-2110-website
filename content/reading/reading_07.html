<h3>Convection</h3>
<p>This chapter focuses on atmospheric convection, which is a fancy way of
describing the fact that warm air rises and cool air sinks.</p>
<p>Figure 5-1 shows the role of convection in moving heat around the atmosphere.
A layer model or purely radiative calculateion like we did with the
MODTRAN model will predict a surface temperature that’s higher than the
actual surface temperature. This is because these models ignore the way that
warm air near the surface rises and moves heat from the surface to higher
altitudes, while cool air from higher up sinks down to the surface.
This cools the surface and warms the higher altitudes, and accounting for this
produces much better predictions of the surface temperature and the
greenhouse effect.</p>
<p>The chapter begins by describing the way temperature and air pressure change
as you rise up from sea level to high altitudes. You should understand why
both pressure and temperature change with altitude.</p>
<p>A key concept is the <strong>dry adiabat</strong>, which is introudced on p. 50.</p>
<p>As you prepare for class, think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Figure 5-2 (the part on the right) shows how atmospheric pressure changes
with altitude above sea-level and Figure 5-4 shows how the pressure of water
in the ocean changes with depth below sea-level.
Why does water pressure follow a straight line as depth changes, but
air pressure follow a bending curve?</li>
<li>If the left side of Fig. 5-2 didn’t have labels showing <strong>troposphere</strong>,
<strong>tropopause</strong> and <strong>stratosphere</strong>, how would you know where to put the labels
from the curve showing the temperature at different altitudes?</li>
<li>What are the important differences between the layer-model approach to
calculating the greenhouse effect and the skin-model on pp. 45–46 and
Fig. 5-3?</li>
<li>What does <strong>adiabatic</strong> mean?</li>
<li>If you raise a <strong>parcel</strong> of air (a parcel is a bunch of air that moves
together as though it were in an imaginary bag that keeps it together),
it will cool off, and if you lower a parcel, it will get warmer.
Why?</li>
