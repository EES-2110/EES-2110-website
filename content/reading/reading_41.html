<h3>Reading Notes:</h3>
<p>There are three readings. Start with the blog by Mark Maslin that gives a short
history of international climate negotiations. Then read the chapters from
<em>Climate Casino</em>, and finally read the chapter from
<em>The Climate Fix</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pielke (<em>The Climate Fix</em>) and Nordhaus (<em>Climate Casino</em>) offer
different accounts of the history of international treaties and policies to
manage climate change. Pay attention to what each author says.</li>
<li>Much of the focus is on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC), signed in 1992 and ratified by all 193 member states of the
United Nations. Maslin’s short history of climate negotiations gives the
history of this.
<ul>
<li>Four important milestones in this process were:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Establishing the international treaty (UNFCCC) that laid out the basic
principles of responsibility to protect the world from dangerous
climate change. The treaty was signed in 1991 and came into force
in 1994.</li>
<li>The Kyoto Treaty, which spelled out in detail what each country’s
responsibilities were under the UNFCCC. The Kyoto treaty was signed
in 1997. It became legally binding once 55 countries had ratified it,
which didn’t happen until 2005. The US never ratified it, and the treaty
expired in 2012.</li>
<li>The Copenhagen Agreement, signed in 2009, which replaced the Kyoto Treaty.
The nations knew that the US Congress would not ratify a new treaty, so
they developed an Agreement instead, which was not legally binding.</li>
<li>The 2015 Paris Agreement, which established a schedule for each
country to reduce emissions in order to try to limit warming to
no more than 2°C, and preferably
less than 1.5°C.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The UNFCCC is legally binding on its signatories, and requires them to
“stabiliz[e] greenhouse gases concentrations in the atmosphere at a level
that would avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate
system.”
A problem is that the Framework did not define what constituted
“dangerous anthropogenic interference,” or spell out any specific actions
that the signatories would have to take under the treaty.</li>
<li>In subsequent years, much of the world’s scientific and climate policy
elites arrived at a rough consensus that raising the average temperature
of the earth by more than 2°C relative to preindustrial
temperatures would constitute dangerous interference. Both Nordhaus and
Pielke present critical examinations of this judgment.</li>
<li>The details of implementing the pledge under UNFCCC (both defining
“dangerous interference” and deciding on specific actions) was left to
subsequent negotiations, and the signatory nations have met every year at
“conferences of parties” (COPs) to hammer out details. The most important
implementation agreement was a treaty signed in Kyoto in 1998, but never
ratified by the United States, and it expired in 2012, but was superseded
by the Copenhagen Treaty in 2009. Both Nordhaus and Pielke discuss the
Kyoto treaty and its pros and cons.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>As you read this history and the discussion of the goal of limiting warming
to no more than 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures, try
to become familiar with the history and think critically about the kinds of
policies that were pursued and those that were not given serious consideration.</li>
</ul>
