### Notes:

No new reading. 

As you prepare for class, bring questions about things you didn't understand 
from previous chapters. Also, think about these review questions:

* What are the laws of blackbody radiation?
* How do you use a layer model?
* What makes some greenhouse gases more powerful than others?
* What are the important differences between the **layer-model** approach to 
  calculating temperature and the **skin-model** on pp. 45--46?
* How does band saturation work? How can you recognize saturation in 
  MODTRAN?
* How do you use MODTRAN to calculate the effect of doubling CO~2~?
* How do you use the full-spectrum RRTM model to calculate the effect of 
  doubling CO~2~?
