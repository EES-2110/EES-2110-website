<h3>Reading Notes:</h3>
<p>We will discuss geoengineering as an alternative to rapidly cutting greenhouse gas emissions. For today, we will focus on <strong>solar radiation management</strong>: Techniques for cancelling out the enhanced greenhouse effect by blocking sunlight from reaching the earth.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start with the short factsheet about solar-radiation management geoengineering by Burns. This gives a clear and concise overview of what the big picture is.</p></li>
<li><p>As you read Pielke, pay attention to his discussion of the big picture. What does he mean by a <strong>technological fix</strong>, and what does he think about technological fixes for environmental problems?</p></li>
<li><p>What are Daniel Sarewitz’s criteria for successful technological fixes?</p></li>
<li><p>In the context of technological fixes, Pielke describes climate change as a “wicked problem.” This is a phrase with a specific meaning in public policy analysis. It comes from a 1973 paper,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> which defines “wicked problems” as possessing ten different properties, all of which make it very difficult, even impossible, to find satisfactory solutions. A few of these properties include: Wicked problems have high stakes, so it is unacceptable to choose a solution that proves ineffective. They are plagued by uncertainty, so no one can tell in advance whether a solution will work well. They invoilve important tradeoffs, so anything that makes a solution attractive to one constituency will make it unattractive to another. They are irreversible, so trial and error is not an effective approach for finding good solutions.</p>
<p>As you read this chapter, think about how the problem of geoengineering the climate fits the criteria of a wicked problem.</p></li>
<li><p>What does Pielke think about solar radiation management in terms of Sarewitz’s criteria?</p></li>
<li><p>Pielke begins this chapter by discussing geoengineering as a “<strong>Plan B</strong>” for climate policy. What does he mean by this?</p></li>
<li><p>Where Pielke talks about “Plan B,” Nordhaus describes geoengineering as “<strong>salvage therapy</strong>” for the planet. How does his account of solar radiation management compare to Pielke’s? Where do the two agree and where do they disagree?</p></li>
<li><p>Nordhaus, as an economist, focuses a lot on costs, comparing the costs and the benefits of any policy. How does he asses the costs and benefits of geoengineering?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This optional reading was written by a group of leading experts in climate science and policy about how solar radiation management geoengineering could play an important, but temporary, role in keeping global warming below 1.5°C.</p>
