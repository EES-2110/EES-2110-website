<div id="exercise-4.1-methane" class="section level2">
<h2>Exercise 4.1: Methane</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Methane has a current concentration of 1.7 ppm in the atmosphere and
is doubling at a faster rate than CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
</blockquote>
<div id="part-a" class="section level3">
<h3>Part (a)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Would an additional 10 ppm of methane in the atmosphere have a larger or
smaller impact on the outgoing IR flux than an additional 10 ppm of CO<sub>2</sub>
at current concentrations?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
I ran MODTRAN three times.</p>
<ul>
<li>One run was a baseline, which used the current concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> and
CH<sub>4</sub>.</li>
<li>Then I ran MODTRAN with the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration increased by 10 ppm.</li>
<li>Finally, I ran it a third time with the baseline value for CO<sub>2</sub>, but with
CH<sub>4</sub> increased by 10 ppm.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the baseline run, the intensity of outgoing longwave light
was 299. Watts per square meter.
Increasing CO<sub>2</sub> by 10 ppm decreased the outgoing longwave light by
0.1 W/m<sup>2</sup>, to
298.
and increasing CH<sub>4</sub> by
10 ppm decreased the outgoing longwave light by
3.1 W/m<sup>2</sup> to
296..
The change in I<sub>out</sub> for methane is is around
25. times as much as for CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>The difference is because absorption for CO<sub>2</sub> is strongly saturated, but the
absorption for CH<sub>4</sub> is not saturated. Another way to think about this is that
a 10 ppm increase in CO<sub>2</sub> increases the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> by
2.% and a 10 ppm increase in
CH<sub>4</sub> increases the amount of CH<sub>4</sub> by
590.%.</p>

<div id="part-b" class="section level3">
<h3>Part (b)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Where in the spectrum does methane absorb? What concentration does it
take to begin to saturate the absorption in this band? Explain what you are
looking at to judge when the gas is saturated.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
The plots below show the MODTRAN spectrum with all gases set to zero except
methane. Methane absorbs most strongly around 1300 wavenumbers.</p>
<p><img src="/homework_solutions/homework_02_answers_files/figure-html/ex_4_1_b-1.png" width="480" /><img src="/homework_solutions/homework_02_answers_files/figure-html/ex_4_1_b-2.png" width="480" /><img src="/homework_solutions/homework_02_answers_files/figure-html/ex_4_1_b-3.png" width="480" /><img src="/homework_solutions/homework_02_answers_files/figure-html/ex_4_1_b-4.png" width="480" /><img src="/homework_solutions/homework_02_answers_files/figure-html/ex_4_1_b-5.png" width="480" /><img src="/homework_solutions/homework_02_answers_files/figure-html/ex_4_1_b-6.png" width="480" /><img src="/homework_solutions/homework_02_answers_files/figure-html/ex_4_1_b-7.png" width="480" /><img src="/homework_solutions/homework_02_answers_files/figure-html/ex_4_1_b-8.png" width="480" /><img src="/homework_solutions/homework_02_answers_files/figure-html/ex_4_1_b-9.png" width="480" /></p>
<p>As we increase the methane concentration, the big spike around 1300 wavenumbers
gets bigger until it bottoms out on the purple line. This happens somewhere
around 8, 16, or 32 ppm, so any of those anwers would be correct. But the
spectrum is complicated and so is its saturation, so other answers are plausible
if they are supported by sound reasoning.</p>

<div id="part-c" class="section level3">
<h3>Part (c)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Would a doubling of methane have as great an impact on the heat balance as
a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub>?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
The baseline value for I<sub>out</sub> is
299. W/m<sup>2</sup>.
If we double CO<sub>2</sub>, it drops to
295. W/m<sup>2</sup>, a decrease of
3. W/m<sup>2</sup>,
and if we double CH<sub>4</sub>, it drops to
298. W/m<sup>2</sup>, a decrease of
0.9 W/m<sup>2</sup>.
Doubling CO<sub>2</sub> has the larger effect because there is a lot more CO<sub>2</sub> in the
atmosphere and that is more important than how saturated its absorption is.</p>
<p>You can see this if you look at the plots below. Notice that the effect of
doubling CO<sub>2</sub> isn’t to make the big CO<sub>2</sub> absorption feature get deeper, but
to make it wider. You can see this if you compare the baseline to the doubled
CO<sub>2</sub> spectrum where the spectrum crosses the 240 K blackbody curve
near 600 cm<sup>-1</sup> and around 750 cm<sup>-1</sup>. Compare this to the very
small change in the methane spike near 1300 cm<sup>-1</sup> (you have to look
very carefully at the doubled methane spectrum to notice this).</p>

<h3>Part (d)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is the “equivalent CO<sub>2</sub>” of doubling atmospheric methane? That is to
say, how many ppm of CO<sub>2</sub> would lead to the same change in outgoing IR
radiation energy flux as doubling methane? What is the ratio of ppm CO<sub>2</sub>
change to ppm methane change?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
When we double CH<sub>4</sub>, I<sub>out</sub> is
297.8 W/m<sup>2</sup>.
We need to adjust CO<sub>2</sub> to produce the same I<sub>out</sub> with the defailt value of
1.7 ppm CH<sub>4</sub>. After some trial and error, this turns out to be about
480 ppm,
which has I<sub>out</sub> = 297.8.
The ratio of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\COO\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\methane\)</span> is

<h2>Exercise 4.3: Water vapor</h2>

<h3>Part (a)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How much extra outgoing IR would you get by raising the temperature of the
ground by 5°C? What effect does the ground temperature have on the
shape of the outgoing IR spectrum and why?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/homework_solutions/homework_02_answers_files/figure-html/ex_4_3_a-1.png" width="672" /><img src="/homework_solutions/homework_02_answers_files/figure-html/ex_4_3_a-2.png" width="672" /></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
Raising the ground temperature raises the entire spectrum, and the intensity of
outgoing longwave radiation increases from
299. W/m<sup>2</sup> to
321. W/m<sup>2</sup>: a change of
23. W/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<h3>Part (b)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>More water can evaporate into warm air than into cool air. Change the
model settings to hold the water vapor at constant relative humidity
rather than constant vapor pressure (the default), calculate the change
in outgoing IR energy flux for a 5°C temperature increase.
Is it higher or lower? Does water vapor make the Earth more sensitive to
CO<sub>2</sub> increases or less sensitive?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/homework_solutions/homework_02_answers_files/figure-html/ex_4_3_b-1.png" width="672" /><img src="/homework_solutions/homework_02_answers_files/figure-html/ex_4_3_b-2.png" width="672" /></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
Raising the ground temperature with constant relative humidity
raises the intensity of outgoing longwave radiation from
299. W/m<sup>2</sup> to
313. W/m<sup>2</sup>: a change of
14. W/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>This is a smaller change than when we raised the surface temperature with
constant vapor pressure.</p>
<p>This means that compensating for a change in CO<sub>2</sub> would require a bigger
change in temperature with fixed relative humidity, so the climate is
<strong>more sensitive</strong> to changes in CO<sub>2</sub> when relative humidity is fixed.</p>

<div id="part-c-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Part (c)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Now see this effect in another way.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Starting from the default base case, record the total outgoing
IR flux.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Now double CO<sub>2</sub>. The temperature in the model stays the
same (that’s how the model is written), but the outgoing IR flux
goes down.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Using constant water vapor pressure, adjust the temperature offset
until you get the original IR flux back again. Record the change in
temperature.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Now repeat the exercise, but holding the relative humidity fixed
instead of the water vapor pressure.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The ratio of the warming when you hold relative humidity fixed
to the warming when you hold water vapor pressure fixed is the
feedback factor for water vapor. What is it?</strong></p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
In the baseline case,
I<sub>out</sub> = 298.7 W/m<sup>2</sup>.
When we double CO<sub>2</sub> with constant water vapor pressure, I<sub>out</sub> drops to
295.3 W/m<sup>2</sup>
and we have to raise the ground temperature by
0.76 K
to bring I<sub>out</sub> back to
298.7 W/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>When we double CO<sub>2</sub> with constant water relative humidity, I<sub>out</sub> drops to
295.3 W/m<sup>2</sup>
and we have to raise the ground temperature by
1.2 K
to bring I<sub>out</sub> back to
298.7 W/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>The feedback factor is the ratio of the temperature change with relative
humidity fixes to the temperature change with vapor pressure fixed:
<span class="math inline">\(f = 1.2~\text{K} / 0.76~\text{K} = 1.6\)</span>.</p>
<p>Notice that there is no difference between holding vapor pressure constant and
holding relative humidity constant until the temperature changes.</p>
