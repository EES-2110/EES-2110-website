<h2><strong>Exercise #1: Cloud Effects</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Use the MODTRAN model with the “Tropical Atmosphere” and vary the
clouds.
Note that this model does not consider incoming shortwave light, and
therefore it ignores the albedo effect of clouds. It only calculates the
effect of the clouds on outgoing longwave light for a given surface
temperature. One way to think about this is that it looks at the effect the
clouds have at night.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Run the model three times: First with clear skies, then with
“Altostratus: Cloud Base 2.4 km, Top 3.0 km,”
and finally with “Stratus: Cloud Base .33 km, Top 1.0 km.”
Describe the change in <span class="math inline">\(I_{\text{out}}\)</span> for each type of clouds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the effect warming or cooling?</li>
<li>Which type of cloud has the bigger effect on <span class="math inline">\(I_{\text{out}}\)</span>?</li>
<li>Why do you see the difference between the two types of clouds?</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<div id="answer-1a" class="section level3">
<h3>Answer 1(a)</h3>
<p>With clear skies,
<span class="math inline">\(I_{\text{out}} = 299.~\text{W}/\text{m}^2\)</span>.
With altostratus clouds,
<span class="math inline">\(I_{\text{out}} = 269.~\text{W}/\text{m}^2\)</span>,
which is $ 30.~~/^2$
less, so altostratus clouds
have a warming effect.</p>
<p>With stratus clouds, which are closer to the ground,
<span class="math inline">\(I_{\text{out}} = 288.~\text{W}/\text{m}^2\)</span>,
which is <span class="math inline">\(10.~~\text{W}/\text{m}^2\)</span>
less, so stratus clouds
have a warming effect.</p>
<p>Altostratus
clouds have a bigger effect on <span class="math inline">\(I_{\text{out}}\)</span>. This is because
altostratus clouds are higher in the atmosphere
(the tops are at 3 km, compared to 1 km for stratus), so the tops of
altostratus clouds are cooler than the tops of stratus clouds, and thus
emits less longwave radiation.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Starting set the altitude to zero and select “Looking up.” When you
are looking up, the model reports the longwave radiation coming down to
the surface from the atmosphere and hitting the earth’s surface. This
heat is in addition to whatever heat the earth gets from shortwave solar
radiation.</p>
<p>For simplicity, think of this as the conditions at night, when the sun
is not shining: without sunlight, the temperature of the ground will be
determined by balancing the outgoing heat with the heat radiated downward
by the warm atmosphere and clouds.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, note the downward longwave heat flux (<span class="math inline">\(I_{\text{down}}\)</span>) with
clear sky (no clouds or rain).</li>
<li>Then turn on altostratus clouds and note the change in
<span class="math inline">\(I_{\text{down}}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Next, turn on stratus clouds and note the change in <span class="math inline">\(I_{\text{down}}\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does <span class="math inline">\(I_{\text{down}}\)</span> change when you add clouds?</li>
<li>Do the clouds have a heating or cooling effect? Why?</li>
<li>Which clouds have a greater heating or cooling effect? Why?</li>
</ul></li>

<div id="answer-1b" class="section level3">
<h3>Answer 1(b)</h3>
<p>With clear skies,
<span class="math inline">\(I_{\text{down}} = 447.~\text{W}/\text{m}^2\)</span>.
With altostratus clouds,
<span class="math inline">\(I_{\text{down}} = 447.~\text{W}/\text{m}^2\)</span>,
which is <span class="math inline">\(0~~\text{W}/\text{m}^2\)</span>
greater, so altostratus clouds
have a warming effect.</p>
<p>With stratus clouds, which are closer to the ground,
<span class="math inline">\(I_{\text{down}} = 447.~\text{W}/\text{m}^2\)</span>,
which is <span class="math inline">\(0~~\text{W}/\text{m}^2\)</span>
greater, so stratus clouds
have a warming effect.</p>
<p>Stratus
clouds have a bigger effect on <span class="math inline">\(I_{\text{down}}\)</span>. This is because
altostratus clouds are higher in the atmosphere
(the bottoms are at 2.4 km, compared to 0.33 km for stratus), so the bottoms of
altostratus clouds are cooler than the bottoms of stratus clouds, and thus
emits less longwave radiation.</p>

<h3>Answer for 3(a)</h3>

<p>When I double CO<sub>2</sub>, initially, this reduces <span class="math inline">\(I_{\text{out}}\)</span> so the Earth

<p>With relative humidity set to zero (no water-vapor feedback), the climate
