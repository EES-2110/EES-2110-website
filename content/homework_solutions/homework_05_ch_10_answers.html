<h2>Exercise 10.1: Long-term fate of fossil-fuel CO<sub>2</sub></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Use the online geologic carbon cycle model at
<a href="https://climatemodels.jgilligan.org/geocarb/" class="uri">https://climatemodels.jgilligan.org/geocarb/</a>.
Use the default setup of the model, and notice that the CO<sub>2</sub> weathering
rates, etc., for the transient state are the same as for the spin-up state.
So, if there were no CO<sub>2</sub> spike at all, there would be no change in
anything at year 0. (Go ahead, make sure I am not lying about this.)
Release some CO<sub>2</sub> in a transition spike, 1000 Gton or more or less,
and see how long it takes for the CO<sub>2</sub> to decrease to a plateau.
There are two CO<sub>2</sub> plots in the output, one covering 100,000 years and one
covering 2.5 million years. How long does it take for CO<sub>2</sub> to level out
after the spike, according to both plots?</p>

<h3>Answer to 10.1</h3>
<p>Even after 1 million years (the longest we can plot with the new version of
the Geocarb model), CO<sub>2</sub> hasn’t quite returned to its original value.</p>
<p>At the end of spinup, CO<sub>2</sub> was 272.6 parts per million, and 1 million years
after the spike, it’s 273.1 ppm.</p>

<h2>Exercise 10.4:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Using the SLUGULATOR model at <a href="https://climatemodels.jgilligan.org/slugulator/" class="uri">https://climatemodels.jgilligan.org/slugulator/</a> or
<a href="http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/slugulator/" class="uri">http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/slugulator/</a>,
compare the impact of methane and CO<sub>2</sub> on timescales of 1, 10, 25, 50, 100,
500, and 1000 years.</p>
<p>The SLUGULATOR model simulates releasing a large amount of CO<sub>2</sub> and
methane and then calculates what happens over time. At time zero, the
concentration of each gas is the natural level from shortly before the
industrial revolution: 280 ppm of CO<sub>2</sub> and 1.6 ppm of methane. At one year,
a large amount of each gas is released instantly (after this, there are no
further emissions of either gas).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Run the model using the default model input parameters, setting the left
graph to “Concentrations” and the right graph to “Surface T Anomaly”.
Set the time scale on the bottom to show 10 years.</p>
<p>Move your mouse over the graphs to measure the exact values (a “tooltip”
will pop up next to the cursor telling the time in years and the value of
the line on the graph: concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> or methane, or the warming
due to that gas). Be aware that on the concentration graph, the
concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> is plotted against the left axis while methane is
plotted against the right axis.</p>
<p>What happens to the concentrations of methane and carbon dioxide? Why does
the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> continue to rise after the first year, when
methane is falling?</p></li>

</blockquote>
<div id="answer-to-10.4a" class="section level3">
<h3>Answer to 10.4(a)</h3>
<p>After the spike, methane immediately begins to drop, and by about 35 or 40 years
later, it’s pretty much back to where it was before the spike.</p>
<p>After the spike, CO<sub>2</sub> continues to rise for 35–40 years, and then gradually
falls over the next million years.</p>
<p>When methane falls during the first 50 years or so, it is removed from the
atmosphere by chemical reactions that oxidize it and convert it to CO<sub>2</sub>
and water vapor. CO<sub>2</sub> continues to rise after the initial spike because
the initial spike of methane is being converted to CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<li>What is the warming due to methane at 1 year and at 10 years? What is the

temperature” in the table at the top of the page). Calculate the ratio of
methane-warming to CO<sub>2</sub>-warming at each time.</li>

<div id="answer-to-10.4b" class="section level3">
<h3>Answer to 10.4(b)</h3>
<p>After 1 year, the warming due to methane is 0.029 degrees C. After 10 years,
it’s 0.09 degrees.</p>
<p>After 1 year, the warming due to CO<sub>2</sub> is 0.001 degree, and after 10 years,
it’s 0.006 degrees.</p>
<p>At 1 year, the ratio of methane warming to CO<sub>2</sub> warming is
<span class="math inline">\(0.029 / 0.001 = 29\)</span>.
At 10 years, the ratio is<br />
<span class="math inline">\(0.09 / 0.006 = 15\)</span>.</p>

<li><p>Generating electricity by burning natural gas (methane) releases less than
half as much CO<sub>2</sub> than generating the same amount of electricity by

<p>“Fracking” has dramatically lowered the cost of natural gas, and this has
made coal-fired electrical generation uneconomical, so about half of the
coal generation plants in the United States have shut down in the last 10
years.</p>
<p>Many people think replacing coal generation with natural gas generation
will reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions significantly,
but gas wells that use fracking also leak a lot of methane directly into
the atmosphere.</p>

over whether fracking is helping or hurting the problem of global warming.</p></li>

<div id="answer-to-10.4f" class="section level3">
<h3>Answer to 10.4(f)</h3>
<p>In terms of long-term warming, the move from burning coal to burning methane
is a big improvement because less than half as much CO<sub>2</sub> will be
released into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>However, in the short term (the next 50 years or so), the leaking methane from
the gas wells will produce a lot of warming. It’s possible that enough
methane could leak out of the wells to create more warming in the short-term
than the coal would have done.</p>
<p>However, this methane will disappear from the atmosphere in the next several
decades, whereas the CO<sub>2</sub> from burning coal would remain in the atmosphere
for many thousands of years.</p>
