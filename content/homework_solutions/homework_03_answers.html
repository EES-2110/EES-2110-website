<h2>Exercise 1: Lapse Rate</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Use the online full-spectrum radiation model at
<a href="https://climatemodels.jgilligan.org/rrtm/" class="uri">https://climatemodels.jgilligan.org/rrtm/</a> or <a href="http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/rrtm/" class="uri">http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/rrtm/</a>.
Adjust the lapse rate in the model and document its impact on the
equilibrium temperature of the ground.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And from the notes in the assignment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The RRTM full-spectrum model is a radiative-convective model that
considers the impact of lapse rate on the radiative balance. You can adjust
the amount of sunlight hitting the earth, the albedo, the surface
temperature, the lapse rate, and other parameters including the amount of
cloud cover at different altitudes. The model then divides the atmosphere
into many layers and at each layer, it calculates the amount of heat going
up and down in the form of shortwave radiation (sunlight) and longwave
radiation emitted by the earth and the atmosphere. The model also reports
about the balance of heat going up and down at the top of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Your goal is to adjust parameters until the model reports that
“If the earth has these properties … then it loses as much energy as
it gains.”<br/>
…
For Exercise 1, use the RRTM full-spectrum model, at
<a href="https://climatemodels.jgilligan.org/rrtm/" class="uri">https://climatemodels.jgilligan.org/rrtm/</a> or <a href="http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/rrtm/" class="uri">http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/rrtm/</a>.
For this model, you set the lapse rate, CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, etc., and the
model automatically calculates the imbalance between <span class="math inline">\(I_{\text{in}}\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(I_{\text{out}}\)</span>. You can then adjust the surface temperature until the model
reports, “…then it loses as much energy as it gains.”</p>
<p>I recommend trying lapse rates of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 K/km. After you change
the lapse rate, I recommend setting the temperature to a round multiple of
10 near 270 or 280 K, and adjusting up or down in steps of 10 K until you
change from gaining to losing heat or vice versa, and then change in steps of
5 K, then in steps of 1 K, and finally in steps of 0.5, 0.1, and 0.05 as
necessary until RRTM reports energy balance.</p>
<p>Make a table showing the temperature for each lapse rate, and also make
a graph of temperature versus lapse rate.</p>
</blockquote>
<div id="exercise-1-answer" class="section level3">
<h3>Exercise 1 Answer:</h3>
<p>I varied the lapse rate from 0 to 10 Kelvin/km in steps of 1 K/km.
At each value of the lapse rate, I manually adjusted the surface temperature in
the interactive RRTM model until the heat budget was balanced (the model
reported that “If the Earth has these properties … then it loses as much
energy as it gains.”).</p>

<p>The figure below shows the results. As the lapse rate increases, the change in
surface temperature becomes smaller and smaller. At the last step,
from 9 to 10 K/km, the surface temperature did not change at all.</p>

<div id="explanation" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Explanation:</strong></h4>
<p>You don’t need to have as much detail in your answer as I put in this
explanation.</p>
<p>The reason this is happening is that the closer the basic environmental lapse
rate gets to the dry adiabatic lapse rate, the less stable the atmosphere is
and the easier it is for solar heating of the surface to set off convection
that redistributes heat (basically bringing heat from the surface to the upper
troposphere).</p>
<p>When the environmental lapse rate (ELR) is less than the moist adiabatic lapse
rate, the surface temperature is close to
<span class="math inline">\(T_{\text{surface}} = T_{\text{skin}} + h_{\text{skin}} \text{ELR}\)</span>,
but when the ELR becomes greater than the moist adiabatic lapse rate, there
is so much convection that it disrupts the simple picture I presented in class.</p>
<p>The picture I presented in class works well for an atmosphere like ours, which
is marginally stable (i.e., the environmental lapse rate is roughly equal to the
average moist adiabatic lapse rate).
When the atmosphere is undergoing a large amount of constant convection, then
heat flow behaves differently.</p>
<p>All of that convection transports lots of heat from the surface to the upper
troposphere and brings lots of cold air down from the upper troposphere to the
surface, which makes it hard for the surface to get warmer. This is why the
ground temperature flattens out and stops changing very much after the lapse
rate reaches about 6 K/km.</p>

<h2>Exercise 2: Skin Altitude</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Answer this question using the online MODTRAN IR radiation model
at <a href="https://climatemodels.jgilligan.org/modtran/" class="uri">https://climatemodels.jgilligan.org/modtran/</a> or <a href="http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/modtran/" class="uri">http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/modtran/</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the notes in the assignment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The MODTRAN model ignores shortwave light and only considers longwave
(infrared) light emitted by the earth’s surface and atmosphere. When you
start it up, you pick a locality
(for this exercise, use “Tropical Atmosphere” just as you did
for the exercises in Chapter 4)
and the model will initialize to conditions of radiative balance at that
locality (for the tropical atmosphere, this is 298.52 W/m<sup>2</sup>).
You can then adjust all sorts of parameters (the concentrations of different
gases, the conditions of clouds or rain, and the temperature of the ground),
and the model will calculate the new upward longwave heat flux at the
altitude you specify. You want to make a note of the upward IR heat flux
for the default conditions before you start changing things, and then when
you change parameters, such as the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere, you
can adjust the ground temperature until the upward IR heat flux returns to
its initial value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For exercise 2, use the MODTRAN model.
Choose “Tropical Atmosphere” for Location and keep the altitude at
its default value of 70 km. How would you calculate the skin altitude
from this model?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, back to the exercise from the textbook:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Run the model in some configuration without clouds and with present-day
<span class="math inline">\(p\ce{CO2}\)</span>. Compute <span class="math inline">\(\sigma T^4\)</span> using the ground temperature to estimate
the heat flux that you would get if there were no atmosphere.
The value of
<span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(5.67 \times 10^{-8}~\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}^2 \mathrm{K}^4)\)</span>.
Is the model heat flux at the top of the atmosphere higher or lower than
the heat flux you calculated at the ground?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>From the notes in the assignment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>There’s a typo in exercise 2(a):</strong>
The Stefan-Boltzmann constant should be
<span class="math inline">\(\sigma = 5.67 \times 10^{-8} \mathrm{W/m^2 K^4}\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(10^{-8}\)</span>, not <span class="math inline">\(10^8\)</span>)</p>
</blockquote>
<div id="exercise-2a-answer" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Exercise 2a Answer</strong></h3>
<p>The ground temperature is 299.7 K,
and the intensity of longwave light from a blackbody at this temperature is
<span class="math inline">\(\sigma T^4 = 457.47~\mathrm{W}/\mathrm{m}^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>The actual intensity of longwave radiation from the top of the atmosphere is
<span class="math inline">\(298.67~\mathrm{W}/\mathrm{m}^2\)</span>,
which is much lower.`</p>

the temperatures at the ground and at the tropopause? Assuming a lapse rate

<div id="exercise-2b-answer" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Exercise 2b Answer</strong></h3>
<p>The apparent temperature is the temperature of a blackbody that would emit the
intensity that we observe,
<span class="math inline">\(298.67~\mathrm{W}/\mathrm{m}^2\)</span>.
<span class="math inline">\(I_{\text{out}} = \sigma T^4\)</span>, so
<span class="math display">\[T_{\text{skin}} = \sqrt[4]{\frac{I_{\text{out}}}{\sigma}} =
269.4~\mathrm{K}\]</span>.</p>
<p>This is colder than the ground temperature (299.7 K)
and warmer than the tropopause temperature (194.8 K).</p>
<p>The atmosphere gets colder at the lapse rate, 6 K/km:
<span class="math inline">\(T_{\text{skin}} = T_{\text{ground}} - \text{lapse rate} \times h_{\text{skin}}\)</span>,
so
<span class="math display">\[
h_{\text{skin}} = (T_{\text{ground}} - T_{\text{skin}}) / \text{lapse rate}

<h3><strong>Exercise 2c Answer</strong></h3>
<p>With doubled

<p>The skin altitude for this temperature is

<h3><strong>Exercise 2d Answer</strong></h3>
<p>With cirrus clouds,
<span class="math inline">\(\ce{CO2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(I_{\text{out}} = 279.82~\mathrm{W}/\mathrm{m}^2\)</span>.
The apparent temperature is the temperature of a blackbody that would emit the

<span class="math inline">\(279.82~\mathrm{W}/\mathrm{m}^2\)</span>.
<span class="math inline">\(I_{\text{out}} = \sigma T^4\)</span>, so

<p>The skin altitude for this temperature is
